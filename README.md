# Ultimate Android Reference

The goal of this project is to provide a hand-picked collection of Android libraries, tools, open-source projects, books, blogs, tutorials - you name it.

This project will **only showcase the best, most popular and well-tested resources** that you will actually need rather than overwhelming you with a plethora of low-quality ones.


## Contribution

This project is open to all kinds of contribution in all of its categories. **Together, we can make it the ultimate Android reference available for free, for everyone, forever.**

If you have any suggestion for including more categories, feel free to raise a Github issue for more discussion on it. Please **DO NOT** contribute low-quality, spammy or self-promtional stuff. This project is meant to only include resources, **that make the cut**.

For resource contibution, just follow the following format: `[reference-name](link) - Description`, and raise a Pull Request. If you want to contribute multiple resources, consider raising seperate PRs for each of them.
